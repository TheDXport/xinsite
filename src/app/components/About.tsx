        Hi! I am a Chinese-American raised in Brooklyn, New York, and currently studying @ Binghamton University
        pursuing a major in Computer Science. I have been studying and programming since the sophomore year of high
        school. I am comfortable working with languages such as Java, Python, Javascript, and Typescript, complementing
        them with frameworks such as Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.
